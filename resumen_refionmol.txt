Ionization total cross sections for proton impact on N2, CO, CH4, and CO2.
They used the CDW-EIS model combined with two approximations for the 
molecular targets: 
* AR: Bragg's additivity rule, and 
* MO-LCAO-SCF: a molecular representation of the bound state target wave 
function (the cross section is approximated by a linear combination of 
atomic cross sections where the coefficients are determined from a 
population analysis). 
The FBA was also computed with the MO-LCAO-SCF approximation.

We have combined several features of the classical trajectory Monte Carlo
(CTMC) and the classical over-barrier (COB) models. The systems studied 
are water, adenine, cytosine targets ionized by protons and α-particles 
with kinetic energies ranging from 25 keV amu−1 to 3 MeV amu−1.

Single-electron ionization of adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine as 
well as from RNA uracil base produced by high-energy impact of H+, He2+, 
and C6+ ions with impact energies ranging from 10 keV/amu to 10 MeV/amu.
Simple model combining two classical approximations: the classical 
trajectory Monte Carlo and the classical overbarrier.

Total cross sections for the direct ionization of the cytosine molecule 
by protons in the incident energy range 0.1-100MeV. The first Born 
approximation with the pairwise Coulomb interactions of the ejected 
electron with both the scattered proton and the residual ionized target
was used. The ground state of the cytosine molecule was described by 
means of an accurate one center molecular wave function.

We propose a quantum mechanical description of the ionization process 
induced by light bare ions on DNA bases. Theoretical predictions in terms 
of differential and total cross sections for proton, α-particle and bare 
ion carbon beams impacting on adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine 
bases. The calculations are performed within the first-order Born 
approximation (FBA) with biological targets described at the restricted 
Hartree--Fock level with geometry optimization.

Two different quantummechanical models are proposed: the first one based 
on a continuum distorted wave-eikonal initial state treatment and the 
second perturbative one developed within the first Born approximation 
with correct boundary conditions (CB1). Besides, the molecular structure 
information of the biological targets studied here was determined by ab 
initio calculations with the Gaussian 09 software at the restricted 
Hartree-Fock level of theory with geometry optimization.

Ionization of uracil in collisions with highly charged carbon and oxygen 
ions of energy 100 keV to 78 MeV with the two frameworks: the Continuum 
Distorted Wave with Eikonal Initial State (CDW-EIS) and the first-order 
Born with correct boundary condition (CB1). The 29 orbitals of uracil in 
its fundamental state were computed based on the restricted Hartree-Fock 
method with geometry optimization.

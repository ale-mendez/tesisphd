>> What is the reason for writing the thesis?

The main reason for writing this Thesis is to develop methods to 
accurately describe the electronic structure of targets in collisional 
processes. 

>> What are the current approaches and gaps in the literature?

Currently, there are several approaches for describing the atomic and
molecular structure of these targets. However, some of these methods are 
umpracticle while others require large amount of efforts. 

>> What are your research question(s) and aims?

In this research we aim to introduce new methods that allows one to 
represent the target structure in a simply yet accurate fashion.

>> Which methodology have you used?

We have used several techniques to approach several collisional system:
an inversion method for atoms and small molecules, a Bayesian method to 
optimize targets in electron impact processes, a ... 

>> What are the main findings?

We have found that the introduction of these methods allows one to 
correctly represent the atomic structure of light and heavy atoms, as 
well as small and large molecules in several inelastic processes.

>> What are the main conclusions and implications?

The methods developed are
